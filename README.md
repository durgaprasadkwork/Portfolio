**🚀 About Me**
I’m a Software Developer with 8+ years of experience building, scaling, and supporting enterprise-grade backend and full-stack applications. I specialize in Java 8/11, Spring Boot, distributed systems, and microservices, with a strong focus on JVM performance tuning, secure REST APIs, and high-throughput, event-driven architectures using Apache Kafka.

I’ve delivered business-critical systems in financial services, government, and enterprise content management, handling real-time data processing, asynchronous workflows, and cloud-native deployments on AWS, Azure, and GCP. Alongside backend development, I have built responsive React and Angular web applications, containerized services with Docker and Kubernetes, and implemented CI/CD pipelines for reliable production releases.
