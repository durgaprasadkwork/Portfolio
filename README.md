I am a Full Stack Developer with 9+ years of experience designing, developing, and deploying scalable web applications across enterprise domains. I have deep expertise in Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and modern frontend frameworks like React.js and Angular, building secure, performant, and maintainable solutions.

My experience spans the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and system design to implementation, deployment, CI/CD automation, and post-production support, in both Agile (Scrum/Kanban) and Waterfall environments. I specialize in developing RESTful APIs, integrating relational and NoSQL databases, implementing authentication and authorization with OAuth 2.0/JWT, and building event-driven architectures with Apache Kafka.

I have strong cloud and DevOps skills, deploying applications on AWS and Pivotal Cloud Foundry, implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitLab, containerizing services with Docker, and orchestrating deployments using Kubernetes. My focus is always on maintainable, scalable, and high-performance systems, leveraging monitoring, logging, and automated testing to ensure reliability and observability.

I enjoy mentoring developers, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and driving technical excellence. On GitHub, I showcase projects that demonstrate full stack development, microservices architecture, cloud deployment, and real-time data processing, reflecting both hands-on coding skills and senior-level software engineering expertise.
