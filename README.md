## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Software Developer with 8+ years of experience building and supporting enterprise-grade backend and full-stack applications.  
I specialize in Java 8/11, Spring Boot, microservices, distributed systems, and event-driven architectures using Apache Kafka.  

I have delivered business-critical systems in financial services, government, and enterprise content management, handling real-time data processing, asynchronous workflows, and cloud-native deployments on AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
I also build responsive React and Angular web applications, containerized services with Docker/Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines for production reliability.
