🚀 **About** **Me**
I’m a Software Developer with 9+ years of experience building, scaling, and supporting enterprise-grade backend, full-stack, and mobile applications. My core strength lies in Java-based backend systems, JVM performance tuning, and designing reliable, secure, and scalable services used in real production environments.

I’ve worked extensively on business-critical systems handling high traffic, real-time data processing, and asynchronous workflows. My experience spans distributed systems, microservices, event-driven architectures, and cloud-native deployments using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Alongside backend engineering, I’ve built React and Angular web applications and developed native Android applications using Java and Kotlin. I enjoy working close to production, debugging complex issues, and improving system performance, stability, and maintainability.
